ðŸ’¡ To get the 3D view  :  open Paraview then filters > alphabetic >  then do the following 
  
    # Clip (will slice the mesh in a plane)
    # Isovolume will give 3d pic ( set the max value of alpha.water ) 
    # PLot over line  will give values along the length of a line
    
ðŸ˜˜ Save animation or data depending on what you needd


ðŸ˜› Get the graph directly from paraview: 

    # PlotOverLine  ( from origin to the edge of domain across X axis)
    # Find Data ( just press V ) => (points) alpha.water > 0.9  
    # PLotSelectionOverLine ( to get the arc length )
